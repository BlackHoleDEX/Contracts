# Open Source Attributions

In the spirit of open-source development, we would like to acknowledge Andre Cronje, widely recognized as the “Godfather of DeFi,” for his pioneering work in decentralized finance and for founding Solidly, a project that introduced the innovative ve(3,3) model and set new standards for DeFi protocol design. Blackhole's customisation and new features were build on an adaptation from the Thena v2 codebase, which itself is derived from the Solidly smart contracts that Andre Cronje open-sourced under the GPL3 license. This lineage underscores the collaborative and iterative nature of DeFi development, and we are grateful for the foundation laid by Andre and the broader open-source community.

In addition Blackhole is leveraging Algebra Integral, the latest advancement in concentrated liquidity AMMs and a compelling alternative to Uniswap V4. Algebra Integral preserves the core benefits of concentrated liquidity—such as capital efficiency, customizable price ranges, and optimized fee structures—while introducing a highly modular, upgradable architecture based on a hook (plugin) system. As a result, Blackhole can offer users enhanced flexibility, improved gas efficiency, and access to a growing ecosystem of plugins, positioning it at the forefront of next-generation AMM technology.
